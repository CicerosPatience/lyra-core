# Lyra Core Library
--------------------

A .NET Core implementation for using Lyra boards via a CAN interface. To contact Lyra regarding electronic components go to their website [here](http://www.lyraelectronics.com).

To use the source code you will need at least Visual Studio 2015 and the latest .Net Core toolsets. Shortly you will be able to get the compiled assemblies from Nuget.
